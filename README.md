Be a happy unicorn and try to jump to the other side of the level. But beware, your friends are your enemies and will try to prevent your victory:
After every round, each player places a block in the level - so it becomes more and more colorful and sadistic!
Small pastime about colorful unicorns and their dark soul.
Move and jump using the arrow keys, press R to rotate blocks.
